# V Review (2022)

[V](https://vlang.io/) is a programming language promising to be "Simple, fast, safe, compiled. For developing maintainable software.".
V has a [controversial](https://christine.website/blog/v-vaporware-2019-06-23) [past](https://christine.website/blog/v-vvork-in-progress-2020-01-03) but what is the state of V in 2022?

Is V worth checking out? 

In this post, we'll take a look at V as it exists in May 2022. 

## Rules of engagement

I'll be using the current version of V built from git which is [`50ab2cfd1ae02d4f4280f38c60b8dbd17f7599f6`](https://github.com/vlang/v/tree/50ab2cfd1ae02d4f4280f38c60b8dbd17f7599f6).

To evaluate the language, I'll validate the claims made on their homepage and related sub-pages/documentation.
Where possible, I'll try to include the code used to evalute a claim.
